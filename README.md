# STM32F407VET6_DevBoard
A STM32F407VET6 Industrial Development Board from Alibaba


## Schematics
On some of the AliExpress/Alibaba seller pages, the product description of the board shows a very low resolution, unusable schematic.
After contacting all the sellers, only one of them was able to provide me with the schematics in PDF format.
This file is included in this repository.
